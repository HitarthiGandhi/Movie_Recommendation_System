# Movie_Recommendation_System

Recommendation system is a predicting system and which is used for filtering data where it tries to assumes the preferences of the individual and gives a recommendation based on these preferences. These recommendations are users to items and items to users, and sometimes one user to another user too. There are ample of information available on the internet for hotel, movies, books article, songs, video and many more. One of the simple methods is content based filtering because it suggest items based on the userâ€™s history, so the model provides a very limited degree of novelty. In this project, I used a collaborative filtering technique to recommend movies and a K-NN algorithm to prove the effectiveness of the model. By using this method, our recommendation system suggests the top 5 rated movies. In this proposed solution, we used a threshold value for the similarity between movies, and based on this threshold value results are changing.
